# Engineering Values

## We Value

### Cross Training

We will seek to have more than one developer with working knowledge (code + business case/understanding of importance to organization) of supported apps. “Working knowledge” means the ability to fix an app with little friction.

### Peer Review

We value collaboration in all its forms, especially pull requests.

### Velocity vs. Ideal

Simple solutions, delivered today are often better than perfect solutions delivered tomorrow.
“Quick fixes” are acceptable if they are documented and agreed upon by other developers.

### Not Shaming or Blaming

We strive for a [blameless culture](https://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/) with teachable moments.

* We understand that an existing solution may have been built under extenuating circumstances.
* We challenge _ideas_ not _people_.

### Building the Best

We will build quality apps through best practices like:

* Testing
* [Log aggregation](../standards/logging.md)
* Systems monitoring & [alerting](../standards/alerting.md)
* Adhering, within reason, to the principles of [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/).

We recognize the importance of having a thorough understanding of the problem we are trying to solve with a willingness to create a new, improved solution.

### Documentation

We will write brief & useful documentation for fellow contributors.
The documentation should focus on how to install, run, and deploy an app.

### Acknowledge the Difficulty of Estimation

We recognize that it is hard to translate difficulty points to time and, therefore, can refuse to give time estimate.

### Having Sufficient Time & Advance Notice

* We understand the importance of having sufficient time to do work and will communicate that to stakeholders.

* We seek to help stakeholders understand the importance of giving sufficient notice for work requests.

### Careful Prioritization of Requests

We try to schedule work considering factors like difficulty, impact, and priorities communicated by management/stakeholders.
