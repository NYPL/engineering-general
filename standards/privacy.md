# Privacy & Data Retention Standards

_This is a stub document to define the privacy and data retention standards for products built by NYPL Engineering._

Products (i.e. services or applications) that retain personally identifiable information (PII) for a period greater than 7 days MUST be documented and approved by appropriate Product and Engineering management.

PII includes:

- Patron information (ID, name, email address, address, etc.)
- Bibliographic information (e.g. ID, title, etc.) when it relates to a patron
- Item information (e.g. ID, title, etc.) when it relates to a patron
- Computer information (IP address, etc.)

New third-party products (e.g. Optimizely, Google Analytics) used by the Engineering team MUST also be subject and evaluated according to this standard.
