# Root Cause Analyses

After an outage, security incident or other service disruption a root cause analysis (RCA) SHOULD be performed.

The root cause analysis SHOULD be done as soon as possible _after_ the incident and SHOULD be done as a collaboration between engineers, managers, and parties affected.

RCAs are *blameless*. We're all human and make mistakes. At NYPL we want to encourage an [engineering culture](../culture/values.md#not-shaming-or-blaming) of experimentation, learning, continuous improvement, and making room for mistakes.

Completed RCAs SHOULD be saved in Confluence, under the space for your project. This is a directory for a historical record and shared with relevant parties.
