# Post-mortems

After an outage, security incident or other service disruption a post-mortem SHOULD be performed.

The post-mortem SHOULD be done as soon as possible _after_ the incident and SHOULD be done as a collaboration between engineers, managers, and parties affected.

Post-mortems are *blameless*. We're all human and make mistakes. At NYPL we want to encourage an [engineering culture](../culture/values.md#not-shaming-or-blaming) of experimentation, learning, continuous improvement, and making room for mistakes. We celebrate our post-mortems.

Completed post-mortems SHOULD be saved in the [post-mortems](../post-mortems) directory for a historical record and shared with relevant parties.
