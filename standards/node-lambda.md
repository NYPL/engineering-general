# Deploying Lambdas with node-lambda

We MUST use the node-lambda \([github](https://github.com/motdotla/node-lambda)/[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-lambda)) tool to deploy lambdas.  
[node-lambda's README](https://github.com/motdotla/node-lambda) is a good primer on its commands & configuration files.

Because of a wonky interaction between the `aws-sdk` and `dotenv` node modules.
Developers MUST NOT have a `[default]` environment in their files located in `./.aws/`.
See this [PR-38](https://github.com/NYPL/engineering-general/pull/38) for a full discussion.

## Standards

* Lambdas SHOULD get their description from the `'description'` attribute of `package.json`, not from the `DESCRIPTION` variable in `.env`.

* Each app MUST bring in its own version of node-lambda as a `devDependency`. It MUST NOT rely on a globally installed node-lambda.

* Deployments MUST be done through pre-baked commands in the `'scripts'` block of `package.json` that follow the following rules:

  * The command will be named `'deploy-[ENVIRONMENT-NAME]'`

  * The command will pass environment-specific info as flags to the `node-lambda deploy` command.

  * The command uses the locally packaged `node-lambda`

  * The command knows which AWS account / credentials to use via the `--profile` flag

  * Because we don't put secrets in `.env` (IAM credentials get read via the `--profile` flag), we MUST keep `.env` in source control.

  * Use the `-e` flag for environment, which appends the environment name to the
  name of the function created.

* That is to say, **`.env` MUST NOT contain tier / environment specific configuration. Those must be passed in via flags to `node-lambda deploy`**.

## Examples

A `package.json` that looks like:

```javascript
{ //...snip!
  'scripts': {
    'deploy-production': './node_modules/.bin/node-lambda deploy -e production -f ./config/prod.env -S config/event_sources_prod.json -b subnet-id1,subnet-id2 -g sg-id --role arn:aws:iam::[some-id]:role/[rolename] --profile our-profile-name'
  },
  // ...snip!
}
```

Allows you to have a .env, **in source control** that looks like:

```
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_FUNCTION_NAME=MyFunctionName
AWS_HANDLER=index.handler
AWS_MEMORY_SIZE=768
AWS_TIMEOUT=30
AWS_RUNTIME=nodejs6.10
EXCLUDE_GLOBS="event.json"
PACKAGE_DIRECTORY=build
```

The above is much slimmer than [the boilerplate .env generated by `node-lambda setup`](https://github.com/motdotla/node-lambda/blob/master/lib/.env.example) and allows:

* `.env` to define stage/environment independent variables.

*  pass environment specific variables as flags to the `node-lambda deploy` calls in scripts.

* Finally - since the only secrets are IAM key/secret & those are brought in
  via the `--profile` flag, `.env` can be in source control.

An example of what `config/event_sources_prod.json` might look like:

```javascript
{
  "EventSourceMappings": [
    {
      "EventSourceArn": "arn:aws:kinesis:us-east-1:[alongid]:stream/[streamname]",
      "StartingPosition": "LATEST",
      "BatchSize": 50,
      "Enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Finally, each repo MUST contain an example environment-name.env file (`-f` flag)
that contains names of the RUN TIME env vars and explanatory text as its values.
The README MUST include instructions on putting those config files in their
appropriate place (e.g. running `cp` or some other command to move the example into
a **git ignored** place)
