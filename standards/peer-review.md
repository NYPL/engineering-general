# Peer Review

- All peer review MUST comply with our [Engineering Values](../culture/values.md)

- All work SHOULD go through the process of peer review. It is a form of collaboration and it strengthens  quality.

- It SHOULD involve at least one (1) more experienced developer evaluating whether best practices are followed.

- It MAY consist of at least one (1) session of one-on-one peer review.

  - Example: One team member would make an appointment with another team member to chat about coding progress, followed by walk-through of code-in-review.

- It MAY involve a team member who is less experienced with the tech stack.

  - Example: A team member who is familiar with PHP can sit down with a team member familiar with Ruby on Rails, walking through the idea behind the PHP code, followed by a list concrete tests showing the code works.

## Pull Request Workflow

A common type of peer review involves two or more developers reviewing a pull request from a code repository.

- Developers when submitting pull request, SHOULD mark at least one (1) developer as reviewer.

- Reviewers receiving pull request SHOULD accept the invitation and SHOULD review the code.

- If reviewers do not respond to a review request by the 3rd business day, the author SHOULD follow up with a request for an in-person review.  Project teams MAY establish a rhythm to increase predictability.
  - Examples: "aim for a 4-hour turn-around", "review must be complete by 10am the next business day", or "send a Slack reminder for people who prefer").
