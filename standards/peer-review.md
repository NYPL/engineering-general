## PR Review Guidelines & Best Practices

These guidelines establish the principles and processes for Pull Request (PR) reviews. Following them ensures we maintain high code quality, share knowledge effectively, and foster a collaborative and supportive engineering culture.

All code **MUST** be reviewed by at least one other engineer before being merged.

- **PR reviews are a core responsibility**
  This isn't an "extra" task; it's a fundamental part of every engineer's job, regardless of level. Actively participating in reviews is crucial for code quality, knowledge sharing, and team success. Active participation will also help developers learn new techniques, improve communication skills, and learn to justify technical decisions, supporting personal growth as well as team outcomes.

- **Be timely & responsive**
  Prioritize reviews to keep the development flow moving. Aim for initial feedback within a **24-48 hour** timeframe. If you have thoughts but can't give a full review, consider setting up a 30-minute walk-through with the author. After you have pushed updates based on feedback, **re-request a review** from the original reviewers to notify them that the PR is ready for another look. If you think the notification might get missed, message your team on Slack (or use whatever works for your team) to let them know the PR has been updated. Do what works best to keep everyone in the loop and the process moving.

- **Be constructive & kind**
  Focus on the code, not the person. Frame feedback as suggestions ("What do you think about trying...?") and questions ("Is there a reason we chose this approach?"). Avoid demands. Use "we" or "us" language where appropriate to foster a sense of shared ownership.

- **Understand the goal**
  The PR author should provide a descriptive title and sufficient context in the PR description. As a reviewer, review the code against its stated purpose and acceptance criteria. Does the code achieve what it set out to do?

- **Check for clarity & maintainability**
  Is the code easy to understand? Are variable and function names clear? Will future developers be able to work with this? Look for opportunities to simplify, clarify, or refactor. Good code is not just clever; it's maintainable.

- **Verify functionality & tests**
  Does the code work as expected? Are there adequate tests covering new functionality and edge cases? When necessary, pull down the branch and run the code locally to verify its behavior.

- **Encourage small, focused PRs**
  Smaller PRs are easier and faster to review, lead to more thorough feedback, and reduce risk. Reviewers can and should request that large changes be broken down into smaller, logical PRs as a requirement for approval.

- **Use Draft PRs for early feedback**
  Use GitHub's "Draft" status (or your team's conventions) to show a PR is not ready for formal review. "Draft" can mean either work in progress or a request for early feedbackâ€”be clear about your intent. Reviewers should give feedback on Draft PRs but avoid using "Request Changes" until the PR is marked "Ready for Review."

- **Approve when ready**
  Don't hold up a PR for minor, non-blocking nits once the core functionality and quality are solid. Clearly communicate if a PR is ready to merge or if further changes are required. As a critical quality gate, a PR **must not** be merged if a reviewer has formally requested changes. Once all required changes are addressed and approved, the PR can be merged.

- **Learn and share**
  Use reviews as a chance to learn new approaches or share knowledge. Code reviews are a key part of mentorship and career growth, happening across teams, titles, and levels of experience. More junior engineers can and should review more senior code and vice versa. Remember to point out excellent solutions, not just areas for improvement.

- **Automate where possible**
  Utilize linters, formatters, and CI/CD pipelines to automatically handle style, formatting, and other mundane checks. This frees up human reviewers to focus on what they do best: assessing logic, architecture, and maintainability. Teams are encouraged to use features like `CODEOWNERS` files to automate reviewer assignments.
