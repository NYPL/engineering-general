- All peer review MUST comply with our [Engineering Values](../culture/values.md)

- All work SHOULD go through the process of peer review. It is a form of collaboration and it strengthens  quality.

- It SHOULD involve at least one (1) more experienced developer evaluating whether best practices are followed.

- It MAY consist of at least one (1) session of one-on-one peer review.

  - Example: One team member would make an appointment with another team member to chat about coding progress, followed by walk-through of code-in-review.

- It MAY involve a team member who is less experienced with the tech stack.

  - Example: A team member who is familiar with PHP can sit down with a team member familiar with Ruby on Rails, walking through the idea behind the PHP code, followed by a list concrete tests showing the code works.
