# Javascript:

## NoScript
Semantic HTML must be used where applicable.  This is for Accessibility purposes as well as a general coding best practice. 

Where Javascript is required to enhance the user experience, a no-Javascript fallback is preferred.  

If a site requires Javascript for core functionality, a message must be displayed to non-Javascript users instructing them to enable Javascript.
