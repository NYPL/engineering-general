# Offboarding

It's so hard to say goodbye but sometimes we must at NYPL.

## Remove Accounts

Remove the [accounts](onboarding.md#2-set-up-accounts) that might have been created during the onboarding process.

### Slack

1.  Convert the user to a guest in the `#general` channel.
2.  Set the user to be deactivated in 3 months. (In the Slack administrative interface)

## Remove Keys

Remove the [public key](onboarding.md#3-set-up-keys) added during the onboarding process.
