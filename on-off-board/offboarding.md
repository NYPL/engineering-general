# Offboarding

It's so hard to say goodbye but sometimes we must at NYPL.

## Remove Accounts

Remove the [accounts](onboarding.md#2-account-setup) that might have been created during the onboarding process.

Remove the user from the [NYPL GitHub Organization](https://github.com/orgs/NYPL/people) and all teams that they have been added to.

### Slack

1.  Convert the user to a guest in the `#general` channel.
2.  Set the user to be deactivated in 3 months. (In the Slack administrative interface)
